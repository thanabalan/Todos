#Angular JS Todo Application
============================

1. Allows the user to view a list of user cards. The user information for each card will be retrieved from https://jsonplaceholder. typicode.com/users. Each card will have a "View Todos" button. Use appropriate HTML elements to display different kind of information of the user. 

2. On clicking the "View Todos" button, redirect the user to a different route on the application that displays todos of that user. The todos are displayed in a box centered horizontally and vertically on the page. Make the list scrollable with a fixed height and show an input box at the bottom to create a new todo. Get all todos from https://jsonplaceholder. typicode.com/todos?userId=XXX. Cache the todos in an appropriate storage. 

3. Each todo should (or shouldn't) have a strikethrough based on its "completed" status. A checkbox against the todo allows toggling the state of a todo. Save the updated todo state on the API here: https://jsonplaceholder. typicode.com/todos/XXX 

4. Allow the user to persist created todo on the server using the API at https://jsonplaceholder typicode.com/todos 

5. Allow a user to delete a todo at https://jsonplaceholder. typicode.com/todos/XXX
